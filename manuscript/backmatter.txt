# Appendix A: Getting started

## Linux

### Getting a Lisp implementation

The two implementations I recommend for use in this book are SBCL and CCL, both are very good, open source and generate fast code. If you are on windows or OS X, I recommend CCL, SBCL on Linux. I've had at least two people report to me problems with sbcl on OS X and and my tutorials, which is probably because of improperly built binaries, rather than an actual problem, but if you don't feel like compiling your SBCL from source (which I recommend), stick with CCL on those platforms for now.

Most Linux distributions have both CCL and SBCL in their package repositories, for example on Debian derived systems such as Ubuntu you can install sbcl with apt-get:

~~~~~~~~
$ sudo apt-get install sbcl
~~~~~~~~

But I recommend you download and install binaries manually, distributions sometimes patch CL implementations in order to "fix" something. Also who knows how ancient the version in the package manager is. It is usually recommended to work with the latest releases of CL implementations.

#### SBCL

You can download SBCL at http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html

Once you've done so, uncompress the archive. The example is shown for x86-64 on Linux:

~~~~~~~~
$ tar -jxvf sbcl-1.1.5-x86-64-linux-binary.tar.bz2
~~~~~~~~

Go to the directory:

~~~~~~~~
$ cd sbcl-1.1.5-x86-64-linux/
~~~~~~~~

The file `INSTALL` has information about how to configure the installation, but the default should suit your needs just fine, type:

~~~~~~~~
$ sh install.sh
~~~~~~~~

type `sbcl` into the command line to see if it works OK. you should get a prompt starting with an `*`. I have the habit of typeing `(+ 1 2)` in order to see if it really works, and I have never gotten an answer different than 3 so far, that's reliable software :)


#### CCL

You can get CCL from http://ccl.clozure.com/download.html The distribution contains both the 64 and 32 bit binaries. [Chapter 2](http://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter2.html) of the CCL manual contains information on how to obtain and install CCL if you need it.

After you download CCL, uncompressed the archive with the following command:

~~~~~~~~
$ tar -xzvf ccl-1.8-linuxx86.tar.gz
~~~~~~~~

CCL is started by a shell script in the `ccl/scripts` directory, named `ccl` or `ccl64` for the 32 and 64 bit versions respectively. The way you install CCL is by copying one (or both) of these scripts to a directory on your path, and editing them to point to the CCL directory you just uncompressed. so for example if my `ccl` directory is in my home directory, named `/home/pav` on Linux:

~~~~~~~~
$ sudo cp /home/pav/ccl/scripts/ccl64 /usr/local/bin
~~~~~~~~

I then edit it to point to the `ccl` directory by setting the value of the variable `CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY` at the top of the file to the `/home/pav/ccl/`.

Since I don't use the 32 bit version, I rename the file to simply `ccl`

~~~~~~~
$ sudo mv /usr/local/bin/ccl64 /usr/local/bin/ccl
~~~~~~~

I then ensure the file is executable:

~~~~~~~
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ccl
~~~~~~~

type `ccl` at the command line. The prompt should be `?`. Type some expression like `(+ 1 2)` to see if it works.

### Installing Quicklisp

Quicklisp is a package manager for lisp. It handles downloading and installation of libraries. Installing it is rather easy. More information and documentation can be found at http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/

Download the file http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

Load it with sbcl or ccl:

~~~~~~~~
$ sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
~~~~~~~~

This will load the file into lisp and we can proceed to install it. Type the following into the lisp prompt:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
~~~~~~~~

This will install quicklisp in your home directory.

In order to make sure quicklisp is loaded every time you start lisp, type the following:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(ql:add-to-init-file)
~~~~~~~~

And you're done. You can now quickload libraries, for instance the following command will install the Restas web framework:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(ql:quickload "restas")
~~~~~~~~

### Recommended editors

* Emacs and Slime: The best option if you already know it, or you are willing to learn it. 
* Vim and Slimv: The next best thing. Vim isn't actually easier to learn than Emacs, but if you already know it, it can get the job done.
* All the other options pretty much stink, but Kate at least has a built in terminal, so it's a bit easier to work with lisp interactively.

## Windows

### Getting a Lisp implementation

The implementation I recommend on Windows is CCL, you can download it from [here](http://ccl.clozure.com/download.html).

After you've downloaded the file, uncompress  it in the directory `C:\ccl`.

The `ccl` folder will have two executables, one named `wx86cl` for 32 bit systems, and `wx86cl64` for 64 bin systems.

At the command prompt, we can start the application by typing:

~~~~~~~~
 > c:\ccl\wx86cl
~~~~~~~~

Let's make it possible to start ccl simply by typing `ccl`. I'll demonstrate for the 32 bit version, it is equivalent for the 64 bit.

First, rename the `wx86cl` and `wx86cl.image` files to `ccl` and `ccl.image` respectively. Now, we need to set up the PATH enviromental variable so that windows knows where to find CCL.

For Windows 7, click the Start menu, and right click on `Computer` and select `properties`. From the sidebar select `Advanced system settings`. At the bottom of the window, click on the `Environment Variables` button. In the second pane, called `System variables`, search for the `Path` variable, select it, click on `Edit`. At The end of the `Variable value` field, append the following: `;C\ccl\`. Click OK. Open a command prompt, and type ccl, it should greet you with a message. That's it, you have CCL installed.

### Installing Quicklisp

Quicklisp is a package manager for lisp. It handles downloading and installation of libraries. Installing it is rather easy. More information and documentation can be found at http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/

Download the file http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp

Open a command prompt, and go to the directory where you downloaded it:

~~~~~~~~
 > chdir path\to\download\directory
~~~~~~~~

Load it with ccl:

~~~~~~~~
 > ccl --load quicklisp.lisp
~~~~~~~~

This will load the file into lisp and we can proceed to install it. Type the following into the lisp prompt:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
~~~~~~~~

This will install quicklisp in your home directory.

In order to make sure quicklisp is loaded every time you start lisp, type the following:

{:lang="common-lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(ql:add-to-init-file)
~~~~~~~~

You can now install lisp libraries using the `ql:quickload` command. Note that some libraries we'll be using depend on haveing OpenSSL installed, so make sure you install it, a third party installer is available from [here](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

Restart CCL, to test if it worked:

~~~~~~~~
 ? (quit)
 > ccl
 ? (ql:quickload "restas")
~~~~~~~~

If it started downloading and installing Restas, you're done. You can now quickload libraries.

### Recommended editors

* Emacs and Slime: The best option if you already know it, or you are willing to learn it.
* Lisp Cabinet: A bundle of Emacs and various lisp implementations, an easy way to install Lisp and Emacs, with various customizations.
* Vim and Slimv: The next best thing. Vim isn't actually easier to learn than Emacs, but if you already know it, it can get the job done.
* Sublime Text2: Seems to be acceptable for editing lisp code.
* LispIDE: Barely qualifies as an IDE, but is an option you can look into.
* Notepad++: Popular code editor for Windows. Minimally acceptable as a lisp editor.

# Appendix B: Recommended reading

## Online tutorials

A lisp tutorial I like is [Lisp in small parts](http://lisp.plasticki.com/)

If you are new to programming, people usually recommend the free book [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/).

For experienced hackers new to lisp, [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) is probably the best way to learn the language.

## Cliki: The Common Lisp wiki

Almost all information you would want about Common Lisp can be found on [Cliki](http://cliki.net).

## IRC

I (and many lispers) hang out on irc on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) server. Channels I frequent include `#lispweb` and `#lisp`. You can also find help on `#clnoobs`.

Check out a bunch of other lisp-related channels on [cliki](http://www.cliki.net/IRC).
